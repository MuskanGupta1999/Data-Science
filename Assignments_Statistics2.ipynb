    "#Background\n",
    "In quality control processes, especially when dealing with high-value items, destructive sampling is a necessary but costly method to ensure product quality. The test to determine whether an item meets the quality standards destroys the item, leading to the requirement of small sample sizes due to cost constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Scenario\n",
    "A manufacturer of print-heads for personal computers is interested in estimating the mean durability of their print-heads in terms of the number of characters printed before failure. To assess this, the manufacturer conducts a study on a small sample of print-heads due to the destructive nature of the testing process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Data\n",
    "A total of 15 print-heads were randomly selected and tested until failure. The durability of each print-head (in millions of characters) was recorded as follows:\n",
    "1.13, 1.55, 1.43, 0.92, 1.25, 1.36, 1.32, 0.85, 1.07, 1.48, 1.20, 1.33, 1.18, 1.22, 1.29"

    "# Rationale for Using the t-distribution:\n",
    "Since the sample size is small (n < 30) and the population standard deviation is unknown, we use the t-distribution instead of the normal distribution. The t-distribution accounts for the additional uncertainty in estimating the population standard deviation from a small sample, which results in wider confidence intervals."
